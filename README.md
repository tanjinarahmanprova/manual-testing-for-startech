Mindmap: -[Xmind](https://xmind.app/download/?fbclid=IwAR1RHoYK2xm2ay9XU6mQKowyQhYlrr3urPm95NVfFx1V5la8xu6hsXGAgQ8)
Test Case Management: Microsoft Excel

## Test Plan
A test plan is a document that details the scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and methodology for testing a software application. It encompasses the test strategy, specific test scenarios, and test cases, along with the entry and exit criteria for the testing phase. Additionally, the test plan outlines the roles and responsibilities of the testing team and incorporates risk management strategies to address potential issues during the testing process.

## Mindmap
A mind map visually presents ideas, concepts, or processes pertinent to software testing. Often employed for brainstorming, it helps to organize and structure testing strategies, test scenarios, and test cases efficiently.

## Test Scenario
A test scenario is developed prior to the commencement of actual testing. It encompasses plans for testing the product, the required team size, environmental conditions, the creation of test cases and test plans, and the identification of all features slated for testing within the product.

## Test Case
A test case provides a thorough specification of inputs, execution conditions, testing procedures, and expected outcomes for a specific test scenario. Its purpose is to validate the functionality or performance of a software application.

## Test Summary Report
A test summary report is a document that summarizes the testing activities, results, and findings of a specific testing effort. It offers valuable insights into the status of the software under test, the quality of the product, and any issues encountered during testing. Test summary reports summarizing the overall test results will be generated to provide a comprehensive overview of the testing outcomes.

## Bug Report
A bug report is a document that provides detailed information about a defect or issue discovered during testing. It typically includes a description of the bug, steps to reproduce it, severity level, relevant screenshots or videos, environment details, and any other pertinent information to assist developers in identifying and resolving the issue.

## Test Metrics
Test metrics are numerical measures used to evaluate the quality, progress, and efficiency of testing processes. They provide insights into coverage, defects, execution, resources, and risks, enabling informed decision-making. Test metrics reports summarize key testing data, such as pass/fail rates and execution time, offering a comprehensive overview of the testing performance.
